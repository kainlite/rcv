# Gabriel Garrido

## Cloud Engineer / SRE / DevOps

Godoy Cruz, Mendoza, Argentina

## Profile

Hey, I'm Gabriel. I started my journey configuring Linux routers (networking) at the age of 16 and became a big fan
of Linux. I started my professional journey as a Linux system administrator (which I did for about 10 years), during which
I did a lot of automation, managed more than 2000 servers, and created my own chef-like solution. Then I started learning
about DevOps and the whole movement, which got me into my first DevOps position.

From there I navigated back to SRE (administration, observability, monitoring) while I did a bit of cloud architecting
and engineering. In my first few years I worked with AWS a lot, then Azure, and now again AWS. While the trajectory
wasn't a straight line, my focus is clear: SRE. I discovered along the way that observability, monitoring,
incident response, and automation are key to any successful product, and that's what I really enjoy doing.
During my time as SRE I have built and improved many systems architectures using Terraform,
observed and monitored using Datadog/Grafana/Prometheus, and created internal tooling (Go/Bash).
My goal is to continue growing on the SRE track toward staff-level engineering, driving reliability and
operational excellence at scale.

I share practical SRE tips, DevOps insights, Kubernetes tips, and automation strategies on my blog.

Some of my hobbies are playing guitar, riding my bike, and coding.
