# CURRICULUM VITAE

## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Gabriel and I'm living in Mendoza, Argentina, I'm a seasoned systems engineer and DevOps Practitioner.
I've been working implementing systems, solutions and creating different tools to help deliver software faster in a safe
and secure way for the last 15 years, I'm always working on myself to get better and learn more, 
I'm always reading about new technologies and tools, I also put some of my ideas and tests in my blog.

A bit of history about myself, I started at a very young age playing with linux using it as a router on really really 
old computers with minimalist distributions, after some time I started learning about networking and got the CCNA certification 
which made me gain more interest in linux, after some more time I started working as a system administrator which 
basically was automating and helping/working with developers and product owners to deliver systems, applications and products 
in a secure and reliable way, over the years I have worked with different languages, 
distributions, virtual machines and finally containers and serverless functions (kubeless, lambda), and many other tools, 

I'm planning to start another blog soon to document my web3 journey, I think writing and explaining things really helps
to cement and put everything learned in the long term memory, part of this is what I have learnt about smart contracts.

Some of my hobbies are playing guitar, ridding my bike and coding.
